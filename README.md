# Stock-Prediction

## About the project
Stock market prediction and analysis are some of the most difficult jobs to complete. There are numerous causes for this, including market volatility and a variety of other dependent and independent variables that influence the value of a certain stock in the market. These variables make it extremely difficult for any stock market expert to anticipate the rise and fall of the market with great precision.
